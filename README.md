This program calculates various parameters of a triangle based on the coordinates of its vertices and determines the position of a point relative to the triangle. The coordinates of the three vertices (A, B, C) and point O are input.

The program then calculates:

The lengths of the sides of the triangle using the distance formula between two points.
The distances from each vertex to point O.
Checks whether all points lie on the same line or if the coordinates of the vertices coincide.
Finds the shortest side of the triangle.
Calculates the semi-perimeter and area of the triangle using Heron's formula.
Computes the height of the triangle from the vertex with the smallest angle.
Afterward, the program analyzes the position of point O:

It checks whether point O coincides with any vertex or lies on a side of the triangle.
It determines whether point O is inside or outside the triangle.
The program outputs the results, including the height of the triangle, the lengths of its sides, and the position of point O relative to the triangle.
